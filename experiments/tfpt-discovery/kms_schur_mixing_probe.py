r"""kms_schur_mixing_probe -- SEAM.CFIN.KMSMIX.01 + SEAM.CFIN.SCHURMIX.01
(EXPLORATION ONLY, experiments/; round 55, reviewer priority 5: the
PHYSICAL MECHANISM the block Wick functor awaits.  Round 52
(wick_block_functor_probe) constructed the canonical C6-covariant
block object G_c on the deployed 16-dim one-particle space and
MEASURED the deployed seam vacuum SEAM-DIAGONAL -- the functor's
value level is a pure candidate awaiting a channel-mixing STATE.
THIS probe constructs that state via the two reviewer routes: (M1)
the fermionic KMS state of a C6-invariant mixing one-particle
Hamiltonian, and (M2) the Schur/Feshbach dressing -- boundary
elimination of a coupled diagonal state -- the SAME operation that
creates the RH port.)

FEASIBILITY / REDUNDANCY CHECK (done against the corpus FIRST,
2026-08-09 -- read end to end: wick_block_functor_probe (round 52),
wick_mixing_covariance_probe (round 51), seam_wick_functor_probe
(round 50), v113/v155/v160/v161, v424/v426/v440, v880/v888):
 * round 52 froze the canonical block candidate G_c (all 15
   cross-blocks at FLOOR = 1/200, C6-covariant, CAR-positive, chi
   sign law) and typed the deployed seam SEAM-DIAGONAL; it built NO
   state-generating mechanism (no Hamiltonian, no KMS, no Schur).
 * v426/v440 deploy the KMS/RP dictionary (C_beta = (I+e^{beta
   K})^{-1}; (LTO-RP)/BW <=> Theta K Theta = -K; Theta C_beta Theta
   = I - C_beta) on an 8-dim COLLAR TOY space (4 marks x 2 sides)
   -- NOT on the deployed 16-dim D5+A3 one-particle space; v155
   carries reflection positivity only as the recorded [P] premise
   (no operator); v160 has no reflection operator at all.
 * NOTHING in the corpus parametrizes C6-invariant one-particle
   Hamiltonians on the 16-dim space, computes their KMS states, or
   asks whether boundary elimination (Schur) of the DEPLOYED
   diagonal state generates carrier cross-blocks.  That is exactly
   this probe.

CAR CONVENTION (FROZEN, v113 / rounds 50-52): 16-dim real Majorana
one-particle space; channels CH(0) = Majoranas 10..15 (A3 boundary
block B, dim 6), CH(i) = {2(i-1), 2(i-1)+1} for i = 1..5 (D5 slot
pairs; carrier block C = indices 0..9).  A quasifree CAR covariance
is G = (I + iA)/2 with A REAL ANTISYMMETRIC; CAR positivity 0 <= G
<= I <=> spec-norm(A) <= 1.  A quadratic Majorana Hamiltonian has
one-particle operator K = i h with h REAL ANTISYMMETRIC (K
hermitian, K^T = -K); the beta-KMS covariance is C_beta = (I +
e^{beta K})^{-1}, equivalently A_beta = -tan(beta h / 2) (exact
identity: iA = 2C - I = -tanh(beta K/2), tanh(i x) = i tan(x)) --
AUTOMATICALLY 0 < C_beta < I (singular values tanh(beta s/2) < 1).
C6 acts by the round-50 lift O16 (slot pairs as units by pi = (0)
(a b)(c d e), identity on the A3 block); Gamma16 = (-I on C) (+)
(+I on B) is the q* grading operator (round 52).

THE TWO FROZEN CONSTRUCTIONS:

 M1 THE KMS ROUTE.  Parametrize K = i h = [[K_C, T],[T*, K_B]]
    with h in the EXACT real-antisymmetric O16-commutant (the
    Majorana-compatible slice of the hermitian commutant; both
    dimensions measured by exact signed orbit walks: hermitian side
    expected 112 = 62 sym + 50 antisym, cross/mixing part 33 =
    round-52 block space, of which the C<->B mixing block T spans
    24).  FROZEN scan family (coarse grid + natural rays -- no
    fitting):
        h(u, t) = -( u * A16_dep + t * A_int ),
    where A16_dep = (+)_8 J is the DEPLOYED diagonal kernel
    (v113/v155 hull) and A_int is the round-52 canonical integer
    covariant cross matrix (units [I2;I2;I2] / I2 / J, orientation-
    propagated).  The overall sign -1 is the FROZEN convention
    aligning the beta -> 0+ linearization A ~ (beta/2)(u A16_dep +
    t A_int) with the canonical orientation of G_c (structural
    rule, frozen before first run; the + branch is reported in the
    anatomy).  Grid (frozen order, beta = 1 primary): (u, t) in
    [(1, 1/8), (1, 1/4), (1, 1/2), (1, 1), (0, 1/4)]; winner = the
    FIRST grid point passing all gates; robustness re-test of the
    winner at beta = 2 (report, not gate).  Gates per candidate:
      (G1) CAR: 0 < C < I strict (theorem; measured ward);
      (G2) exact C6 block covariance + the round-51/52 forced
           zeros on the diagonal of the transposed {a,b} block;
      (G3) all 15 duad cross-blocks nonzero at the frozen floor;
      (G4) the q*/sheet grading carried (round-52 test: [Gamma16,
           O16] = 0, edge law on all 15 messages, Ad(Gamma16)-odd
           support = the 5 vacuum blocks 5/5 FULL, even off-diag =
           the 10 carrier blocks 10/10 FULL);
      (G5) the canonical Pfaffian/chi structure (round-52 test):
           Iota/3-compressed Ahat, all 15 per-edge Pf4 nonzero,
           all 15 block Wick monomials w_blk(M) = sgn(M) prod Pf4
           nonzero, interleaving ward Pf(Ahat|_M) == prod Pf4, and
           the SIGN MATCH sign(w_blk) == sign(w_blk of the
           canonical G_c) on all 15 matchings.
    TYPED: KMSMIX-FOUND(u, t, beta) / KMSMIX-OBSTRUCTED(per-point
    failing gates).  ANATOMY (report): per-orbit rays (u = 1, one
    edge orbit of A_int at t = 1/4) -- which duads each ray LIGHTS
    UP under the tan dressing (the KMS map itself mixes: odd powers
    of h generate blocks outside the seeded orbit -- the Schur
    mechanism inside the KMS route); the + sign branch.
 M1(iv) REFLECTION POSITIVITY (typed honestly).  The corpus
    answer, measured by reading: NO canonical spatial/OS reflection
    theta is deployed on the 16-dim one-particle space (v155:
    premise only; v160: none; v424/v426/v440: the dictionary Theta
    K Theta = -K, Theta C_beta Theta = I - C_beta -- deployed on an
    8-dim collar toy, not on D5+A3).  What CAN be tested: the
    MAJORANA REAL STRUCTURE Theta_0 = complex conjugation in the
    deployed Majorana basis is antiunitary, commutes with O16 and
    Gamma16, and satisfies the deployed v426/v440 dictionary
    AUTOMATICALLY for every K = i h (h real): Theta_0 K Theta_0 =
    conj(K) = -K (BW form) and conj(C_beta) = I - C_beta (the v440
    reflection relation) -- both verified on the winner.  The
    OS-positivity of the two-point block under a SPATIAL seam
    reflection is typed as the NAMED OPEN CHECK RP-THETA-OPEN (no
    deployed theta; the check awaits one).  NOT a gate.
 M2 THE SCHUR ROUTE (the deep cross-connection).  Parent state:
    the deployed DIAGONAL kernel with a C6-invariant carrier-to-
    boundary coupling (the T-block of M1's parametrization, i.e.
    the vacuum blocks of A_int: V = A_int[C, B]):
        A_full = [[kappa A_CC, t V], [-t V^T, m J3]],
    frozen kappa = m = 1/2 (the same KMS-mixing scale on both
    sides; boundary invertible), t = 1/20 (validity PROVEN exactly:
    ||A_full|| <= max(kappa, m) + t * sqrt(lam_max(V V^T)) < 1 by
    the triangle inequality + exact eigenvalue).  Boundary
    elimination (Schur/Feshbach -- the SAME operation that creates
    the RH port):  C_eff = C_CC - C_CB C_BB^{-1} C_BC.  EXACT
    consequence (sympy rationals):
        A_eff = kappa A_CC + (t^2 m / (1 - m^2)) * S,
        S := V J3 V^T   (the boundary-mediated census matrix),
    plus the pure-boundary pseudo-inverse variant (C_BB^+ = C_BB
    for the deployed projection): A_eff+ = A_CC - (t^2/4) S (sign
    flip; report).  MEASURE exactly: the 10 carrier duad blocks of
    S (nonzero census, C6 covariance, unit decomposition a*I2 +
    b*J + traceless-sym, per-edge Pf4 signs vs canonical, {a,b}
    compatibility).  TYPED: SCHURMIX-GENERATES(census) /
    SCHURMIX-DIAGONAL.  If GENERATES: print the unified reading --
    on both fronts (RH port, Wick functor) the real correlation
    lives in the ELIMINATED boundary, not the bare bulk.
 M3 THE 15-SIGNATURE FREEZE (deliverable): the 15 block-correlation
    signatures of the best M1 candidate -- zero/nonzero pattern,
    canonical-unit coordinates and signs, per-edge Pf4 sign, C6
    orbit, q* class -- printed as a FROZEN prediction table (the
    reviewer's 'freeze before any simulation' demand): any physical
    seam state realizing the block functor must reproduce this
    pattern.
 C  CONTROLS (must fire; frozen fire rules):
    C1 PERMUTED ROLES (round-52 rule): conjugating pi by the
       carrier transposition (a, c) and lifting: the covariance of
       the M1 winner breaks (defect >= NZ_FLOOR); the wrong vacuum
       grading Gamma' does NOT commute with the deployed O16; the
       wrong vacuum Arf label breaks the message edge law on
       EXACTLY 8 of 15.
    C2 THE BARE DIAGONAL STATE: t = 0 (KMS of the uncoupled
       deployed kernel): 0/15 cross-blocks at the floor, all 15
       Wick monomials vanish (fails G3 + G5); Schur with t = 0:
       A_eff = kappa A_CC exactly, 0/10 carrier cross-blocks.

FROZEN NUMERICAL PROTOCOL (the ONLY non-exact step is the
transcendental KMS map): exact integer / sympy rational arithmetic
in every structural decision (commutant walks, orbit census,
grading wiring, the ENTIRE M2 route, controls C1-wiring/C2-Schur);
the KMS map is evaluated by certified-precision mpmath at DPS =
60 via the exact hermitian eigendecomposition of K = i h (C_beta
= Q diag(1/(1 + e^{beta lam})) Q^H -- no large-exponential loss),
with the FROZEN two-sided decision thresholds: a quantity is
NONZERO iff |x| >= NZ_FLOOR = 1e-8, ZERO iff |x| <= ZTOL = 1e-40
(structural zeros and exact identities land < ~1e-58 at 60
digits; genuine grid values are >= ~1e-6); any decided quantity
in the open gap fires K2 (ambiguous -- the honest failure).  Pf4
nonzero floor PF_FLOOR = 1e-16 (quadratic in block scale); Wick
monomial floor PF_FLOOR^3.  No RNG, no fits.

KILLS (any one fires => typed gap):
  K0 AST firewall / setup ward breaks              -> PIPELINE-BROKEN
  K1 commutant walk / isotypic ward incoherent     -> COMMUTANT-BROKEN
  K2 KMS route ward breaks (realness, antisymmetry,
     covariance, CAR, threshold ambiguity)         -> KMSROUTE-BROKEN
  K3 Schur route exact algebra breaks              -> SCHURROUTE-BROKEN
  K5 freeze table incoherent with the winner       -> FREEZE-BROKEN
  K7 a control does not fire                       -> CONTROL-DEAD

VERDICT (frozen enum): KMSMIX-MEASURED [typed KMSMIX-FOUND(params)
/ KMSMIX-OBSTRUCTED(<gates>), SCHURMIX-GENERATES(<census>) /
SCHURMIX-DIAGONAL, RP-THETA-OPEN / RP-TESTED(<theta>)] (no kills;
honest OBSTRUCTED / DIAGONAL are first-class outcomes) /
KMSMIX-PARTIAL [kill tokens] / PIPELINE-BROKEN / CONTROL-DEAD.
Exit 0 iff all checks pass and no kill fired; else 1.

FIREWALL: experiments/ probe; EXPLORATION ONLY -- writes nothing
but stdout; no verification/, paper, ledger, changelog or website
surface; no .md, no commits.  AST firewall: banned identifiers
zetazero / nzeros / primerange / isprime / primepi / nextprime /
prevprime (self-scan).  NO physics-realization claim: the [O]
premise (the boundary grammar IS a self-hosting Wick pair
compiler) stays [O]; this probe constructs CANDIDATE states and
freezes signatures -- whether the ACTUAL seam realizes any of them
is untouched; no marker moves.

SPEC v2 AMENDMENTS (fail-first preserved): none at freeze; any
post-run amendment is documented here with the fail-first output
preserved.  (Frozen expectations pre-derived by hand and cross-
checked against an independent scratch derivation of the walk
counts (52 + 10 orbits, 2 forced), the isotypic mults
[10,0,2,2,2,0], the exact Schur identity, and lam_max(V V^T) = 15
BEFORE the freeze; the probe re-measures all of them.)

REPORT (exploration only -- no promotion, no edits):
  * THE PARAMETRIZATION (H1): the hermitian O16-commutant on the
    deployed 16-dim space has dimension %d = %d sym + %d antisym
    (exact orbit walks; isotypic ward sum m^2); the Majorana-
    compatible Hamiltonians K = i h live in the %d-dim
    antisymmetric slice = 33 cross (the round-52 covariant block
    space; the C<->B mixing block T spans 24) + 17 diagonal; the
    only forced zeros remain the 2 diagonal coordinates of the
    transposed {%d,%d} block.
  * THE KMS ROUTE (M1): %s.  beta = 2 robustness: %s.  The KMS
    dressing A = -tan(beta h/2) is itself a mixing machine: the
    per-orbit ray anatomy shows odd powers of h lighting duads far
    outside the seeded orbit -- the Schur mechanism operating
    inside the KMS route.
  * THE RP ANSWER (R1, honest): NO deployed spatial/OS reflection
    theta exists on the 16-dim one-particle space (v155 premise-
    only, v160 none, v426/v440 = 8-dim collar dictionary).  The
    Majorana real structure Theta_0 satisfies the deployed
    v426/v440 dictionary automatically (conj(C_beta) = I - C_beta
    measured); the OS-positivity of the two-point block under a
    SPATIAL theta is the named open check RP-THETA-OPEN.
  * THE SCHUR ROUTE (M2, exact): %s.  From the bare DEPLOYED
    diagonal state + the C6-invariant coupling alone, boundary
    elimination deposits S = V J3 V^T on ALL 10 carrier duads
    (C6-covariant, J-direction, {%d,%d}-compatible, canonical Pf4
    signs) -- the reviewer's cross-connection made concrete: on
    both fronts (RH port, Wick functor) the real correlation
    lives in the ELIMINATED boundary, not the bare bulk.
  * THE FREEZE (M3): the 15 block-correlation signatures of the
    best candidate printed as the frozen prediction table.
  * The [O] premise (the boundary grammar IS a self-hosting Wick
    pair compiler) stays [O]; these are CANDIDATE states + frozen
    signatures; no marker moves.
