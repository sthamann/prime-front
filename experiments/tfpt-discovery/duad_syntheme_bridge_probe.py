r"""duad_syntheme_bridge_probe -- CURVE.CODE.BRIDGE.01 (follow-up to
curve_code_2torsion_probe, verdict CURVE-CODE-PARTIAL): is there a
CANONICAL outer bridge between the code's duad side and the curve's
syntheme side of the S6 duality?

STRUCTURAL RESIDUE OF THE KILL (input facts, re-verified here):
  * code side (V, hbar, sigma, q*): sigma = family 3-cycle, fixed-space
    dim 2, cycle type [3,1,1,1] on the 6 odd refinements (duad side);
    q* odd/Arf-1 with decomposition 1+5bar+10.
  * curve side (A[2], e_2, tau, q_Theta): deck tau acts freely, cycle
    type [3,3] on the 6 odd theta characteristics (syntheme side);
    q_Theta even/Arf-0 with decomposition 1+6+9.
  * the two order-3 classes are exchanged only by the OUTER automorphism
    of S6; Arf is a transport invariant: joint inner census was 0.

THE FROZEN BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION (Sylvester duality, made explicit):
  On each side the doily GQ(2,2) has 6 ovoids = odd refinements
  ("points" Omega of the six-set), 15 points = duads of Omega (v <-> D(v),
  the K6 duad model), 15 isotropic lines = synthemes (perfect matchings),
  and 6 isotropic spreads = totals (1-factorizations).  The action of
  Sp(4,2) = S6 on the 6 totals is the OUTER twist of its action on the 6
  points.  A BRIDGE is a bijection
        beta : Omega_code -> T_curve   (code odd forms -> curve spreads),
  which canonically induces the duality
        Delta_beta : V\{0} -> IsoLines(A[2]),
        v -> D(v) = {o, o'} -> the UNIQUE line shared by the spreads
        beta(o), beta(o')   (every pair of totals shares exactly one
        syntheme -- verified),
  incidence-preserving for every beta (purely set-theoretic; all 720
  dualities arise this way).

FROZEN BRIDGE CONDITIONS:
  (B1) twisted equivariance on the distinguished order-3 elements:
       beta o (sigma|Omega_code) o beta^{-1} = tau|T_curve  (tau^2 variant
       reported as the family related by an inner code symmetry).
  (B2) Arf resolution (consequence, must be CONSTANT over the census):
       the pullback of q_Theta along the bridge -- via the two frozen
       dictionaries below -- equals q_even* := the unique sigma-invariant
       EVEN code refinement, and the NAMED operation
             q* = q_even* + hbar(., A)      (the anchor shift)
       relates it to q* exactly.
       Transport note (frozen expectation): chi_NSR = hbar(., F_Sigma)
       is pinned on the code side by the v752 NS/R LATTICE parity, a
       datum the bare quadruple (V, hbar, sigma, q*) does not carry (the
       joint stabilizer swaps F_Sigma <-> F_Sigma + A); its transport is
       therefore required to be an exact TWO-variant torsor whose
       variants are 'incidence with one of the two tau-fixed lines of
       S*' -- not a constant.
  (B3) distinguished-element pinning: beta(q*) = S*, where S* := the
       UNIQUE spread of the curve fixed by the FULL curve-automorphism
       image <tau, rho> mod 2 (rho = the mu4 rotation = the complex
       structure J = mult by zeta^9; existence+uniqueness of S* is part
       of the CANONICAL criterion and is computed, not assumed).

FROZEN DICTIONARIES (both sides, canonical and equivariant):
  * evens <-> 3|3-splits of the six POINTS: for an even refinement q,
    join odd forms o, o' iff q(v_{oo'}) = 1 where v_{oo'} is the duad
    vector (D(v_{oo'}) = {o,o'}); the graph must be two disjoint
    triangles (6 within-block duads carry q = 1, the 9 cross duads
    q = 0) -- verified, bijective onto the 10 splits.
  * evens <-> 3|3-splits of the six TOTALS: join spreads S, S' iff their
    shared line lies entirely in {q = 0} (each spread contains exactly 2
    of the 6 generator lines of the even quadric, and disjoint
    generators lie in one regulus) -- verified, bijective.

VERDICT ENUM (frozen):
  BRIDGE-CANONICAL      B1-census = torsor under C_{S6}(sigma) (18 per
                        family), S* exists uniquely, full census
                        B1+B3 = |code joint stabilizer| = 6 per family
                        (one orbit incl. the tau/tau^2 swap under code
                        symmetries), and the B2 pullback is constant
                        q_even*: the outer twist canonically identifies
                        the two sides.
  BRIDGE-NONCANONICAL   the exchange exists (B1-census > 0) but the
                        pinning fails (S* not unique, or the census is
                        not a single stabilizer-torsor): the exact
                        ambiguity census is reported.
  BRIDGE-DEAD           B1-census = 0: no equivariant exchange.
  TEST-VOID             a must-fire control does not fire.

CONTROLS (frozen, must fire):
  C1a  inner instead of outer, cross-side: bijections Omega_code ->
       Omega_curve intertwining sigma with tau: 0 (class mismatch
       [3,1,1,1] vs [3,3]).
  C1b  inner instead of outer, same-side: bijections Omega_code ->
       T_code intertwining sigma|Omega with sigma|T: 0.
  C2   wrong Arf target: no B1 bridge pulls q_Theta back to an ODD code
       form (in particular never to q*): the dictionaries are
       even-to-even.
  C3   scrambled sigma: tau|T composed with a frozen transposition of
       two tau-fixed spreads has the wrong cycle type: B1 census 0.
  (positive control = the main census itself: nonzero AND exactly the
  stabilizer torsor, with the explicit orbit verification.)

FENCES (honesty, frozen):
  *  Finite exact algebra only.  The curve side is the exact certified
     model of curve_code_2torsion_probe (E* = Tr(zeta^3 x conj y)/2 of
     type (1,3) on O/2O, O = Z[zeta_12]; period-lattice recognition was
     certified there at dps 120, residuals < 1e-41; nothing numerical is
     recomputed or needed here).
  *  NO matter semantics: the names 5bar/10, 3+2, chi_NSR are used as
     STRUCTURE LABELS only.  The root-level matter reading is separately
     DEAD per gaussian_class_d5_purity_probe (ROOTCLASS-MIXED) and is
     not resurrected in either direction.
  *  This probe does not modify the CURVE-CODE-PARTIAL verdict: the
     inner identification stays dead; the bridge (if canonical) is a NEW
     statement about the outer twist.
